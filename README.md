🌱 EcoCycle – Waste to Value Marketplace

EcoCycle is a single-page web marketplace that converts ignored small plastic waste into valuable, usable products. The platform connects recyclers, sellers, and buyers to enable a transparent circular economy model.

Small plastic waste usually has low individual value and is often discarded. EcoCycle aggregates this waste, verifies it through trusted sellers, recycles it, and transforms it into eco-friendly construction, utility, and décor products — making sustainability economically viable.
